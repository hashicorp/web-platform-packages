We should now be able include custom MDX components in partials. For example, a `"official"` `PluginTierLabel` should render below:

<PluginTierLabel tier="official" />

Comments should NOT mess things up:

<!-- HTML comment but nested -->

But they seem to be messing things up, apparently due to differences in `remark` 12 vs 13.
